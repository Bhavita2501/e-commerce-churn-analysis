# E-Commerce Churn Analysis with Python

In the competitive landscape of e-commerce, understanding and reducing customer churn is crucial. This project focuses on using data analysis and machine learning to tackle this challenge and enhance customer retention.

## Objectives

1. **Data Collection:** Gather data from diverse sources, including transaction records, customer interactions, and website/app usage.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare data, addressing missing values and outliers to ensure data quality.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Gain insights into customer demographics, purchasing behaviors, and potential churn indicators.

4. **Feature Engineering:** Create relevant features for predicting and understanding customer churn.

5. **Churn Prediction:** Develop machine learning models to identify customers at risk of churning, using techniques like logistic regression and random forest.

6. **Model Evaluation:** Assess model performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

7. **Customer Segmentation:** Categorize customers by churn risk to enable targeted retention strategies.

8. **Data Visualization:** Create informative visualizations to facilitate understanding of results, even for non-technical stakeholders.

  
9. **Actionable Insights:** Provide actionable recommendations to empower e-commerce businesses to implement retention strategies effectively by analysing heatmap and correlation between features.
